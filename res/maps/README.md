This file contain all the maps of the game


## How to create a map
For the size of the map you can copy empty.map.<br/>
A map contain the following elements:
    - x: A wall
    - o: A crate
    - v: Teleporter exit
    - ^: Teleporter entry

## Special rule about teleporters:
You must place the teleporter exit before the teleport entry.<br/>
Teleporter are links so the first exit placed is link to the first entry placed.
