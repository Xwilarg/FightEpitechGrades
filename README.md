# FightEpitechGrades
This project is a 2D video game made with the SFML where you fight your EPITECH's grades


## How to play
Go on your EPITECH intranet profile in the "Units and grades" section.<br/>
Select all your marks and click on "Export marks"<br/>
For "File extension" select 'Csv'.<br/>
Let the default delimiter as ';', the charset as UTF-8 and don't tick the 'Hide columns headers' option.<br/>
In the 'options' section you'll need to tick 'Title', 'Final mark' and 'Unit'.<br/><br/>
Once you have done this, copy the file inside the Grades folder.<br/>
You'll be able to select it from the ingame menu.
